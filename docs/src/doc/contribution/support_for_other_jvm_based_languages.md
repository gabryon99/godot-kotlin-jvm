If you want to have support for other JVM-based languages than Kotlin or Java, you have to fork this project.
If you do and have questions, feel free to ask us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/zpb5Ru7v9x).
We're happy to help you out with this.

However, keep in mind that this is not an easy task and it requires that the language, and its tooling, have at least the following capabilities:

- Compile time annotation processing (otherwise you need to register every class by hand).
- Java/Kotlin interoperability.
